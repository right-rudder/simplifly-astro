If you’re curious about flight training, a discovery flight is the perfect first step. It’s a hands-on introduction that gives you a chance to sit in the pilot seat, take the controls, and experience what it’s really like to fly an airplane.

At SimpliFly Flight School in Mesa, Arizona, we make your first flight both exciting and educational. Here’s what to expect on your discovery flight.

## What Is a Discovery Flight?

A discovery flight is a low-pressure, no-obligation introductory lesson. It usually lasts about an hour and includes time on the ground and in the air with one of our certified flight instructors.

## What You'll Experience

- A walkthrough of the airplane and safety procedures
- A short briefing on what to expect during the flight
- Time in the air—where you’ll take the controls and fly under supervision
- A chance to ask questions and explore your goals

## Who Should Take One?

Anyone who’s thinking about learning to fly! Whether you're planning a professional career or want to fly recreationally, a discovery flight helps you decide if flight training is right for you.

## What Happens Next?

After your flight, your instructor will answer questions and help you understand the next steps toward becoming a licensed pilot. If you're ready to move forward, we’ll help you build a training plan.
