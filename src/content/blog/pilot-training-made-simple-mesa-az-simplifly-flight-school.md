Dreaming about flying over the Arizona desert, watching the Superstition Mountains glow at golden hour? At **SimpliFly Flight School** in Mesa, AZ, that first flight isn’t just a dream—it’s your starting line. With experienced instructors, modern training aircraft, and clear, step-by-step programs, **SimpliFly** makes becoming a pilot simple, structured, and seriously fun.

## What Makes SimpliFly Different

1. Personalized training with real momentum. From your very first lesson, you’ll work one-on-one with instructors who care about your goals and pace. The school focuses on efficient training that gets you “safely in the air as quickly as possible,” without cutting corners.

2. Modern, well-equipped fleet. You’ll train primarily in Cessna 172s equipped with classic six-pack gauges plus Garmin G5 flight displays—perfect for mastering fundamentals while getting comfortable with today’s avionics. Multi-engine students train in Diamond DA42 aircraft through a lease, giving you advanced experience that employers value.

3. A clear path to professional flying. SimpliFly supports you from first flight through instructor ratings—and students who complete their ratings here are guaranteed an interview for a CFI position, a fantastic way to build hours toward airline minimums.

4. Financing options when you need them. If you’re mapping out budget and timeline, ask about partner financing (including Stratus Financial) to keep your training moving.

## Choose Your Training Track

Whether you’re flying for fun or eyeing an airline seat, SimpliFly has a program designed for the way you learn:

- **Private Pilot (PPL):** Your foundation—hands-on stick-and-rudder skills, safety, and confidence.

- **Instrument Rating (IR):** Learn to navigate the system and fly precisely, even when the weather isn’t perfect.

- **Commercial Pilot:** Turn skill into profession with advanced maneuvers, safety, and decision-making.

- **Multi-Engine Rating:** Level up with twin-engine performance and procedures.

- **CFI, CFII, and MEI:** Teach, lead, and log the experience that opens career doors.

Or if you’re still exploring, the school’s Pilot Training Made Simple overview breaks down schedules, expectations, and how students progress—super helpful when planning around work or school.

## Start With a Discovery Flight

The most motivating way to begin? Book a discovery flight. You’ll sit up front with an instructor, get a feel for the controls, and see exactly what training will be like. SimpliFly offers standard departure times and can customize if you need something specific—just call.

## Learn Where You’ll Fly

SimpliFly is based at Falcon Field (Mesa, AZ)—a pilot-friendly environment with great year-round weather. You can even check local METARs for Falcon Field right from the school’s site.
