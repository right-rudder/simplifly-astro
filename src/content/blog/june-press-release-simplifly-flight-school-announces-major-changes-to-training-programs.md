## Career-Focused Training

SimpliFly Flight School is now exclusively dedicated to training pilots for airline careers. By focusing solely on the career track, SimpliFly ensures that its graduates are exceptionally well-prepared for the airline industry. The updated curriculum includes specialized training modules and real-world scenarios that airline pilots encounter, providing students with the skills and knowledge necessary for their future careers.

## Structured Training Schedule

To enhance training efficiency, SimpliFly has implemented a structured schedule for different pilot certificates. Specific times of the day are now allocated for various certificates, allowing for a more organized and systematic training process. This structured approach optimizes the use of training resources and instructors, ensuring that each training aspect receives focused attention and benefits the students.

## Unified Training Tracks

In a move to simplify the training process, SimpliFly has eliminated the distinction between accelerated and flexible training tracks. All students will now follow a unified training track, designed to accommodate various learning paces and schedules. This change ensures that all students receive the same high-quality training, regardless of their personal schedules or learning preferences. The unified track combines the best elements of both previous tracks, offering an adaptable training program that meets the needs of all aspiring pilots.

## Multi-Engine Training Program

SimpliFly continues to offer its renowned multi-engine training program, a crucial component of airline pilot training. The multi-engine rating is essential for pilots who wish to operate larger, more complex aircraft. The program covers all aspects of multi-engine operations, including advanced aerodynamics, engine-out procedures, and complex aircraft systems. Students receive hands-on training in state-of-the-art multi-engine aircraft, ensuring they are well-prepared for the demands of airline operations.
