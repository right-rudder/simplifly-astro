At SimpliFly Flight School, we provide the training and foundation necessary for aspiring pilots to progress through their aviation journey, leading them toward the ATP (Airline Transport Pilot) certification. While we do not offer the ATP certification itself, we train pilots up to the point where they are ready to pursue it through an authorized ATP certification provider. Our goal is to help you build the experience and skills necessary to qualify for either a full ATP certificate or the Restricted Airline Transport Pilot (R-ATP) certificate.

## What is ATP Certification?

The Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate is the pinnacle of pilot certification. It allows pilots to serve as the Pilot-in-Command (PIC) of commercial airline flights and signifies the highest level of flying competence. Achieving this certification opens the door to a career as an airline captain.

### Requirements for Unrestricted ATP:

- **1,500 Flight Hours:** The FAA requires a minimum of 1,500 total flight hours for the ATP certificate, which includes diverse experiences such as cross-country, night, and instrument flying.

- **Age Requirement:** Pilots must be at least 23 years old to qualify for an unrestricted ATP.

- **Diverse Flying Experience:** Candidates need specific experience in various flight conditions, including:

  - 500 hours of cross-country flight

  - 100 hours of night flying

  - 75 hours of instrument flying

  - 250 hours as Pilot-in-Command (PIC)

  - 50 hours in multi-engine aircraft (for multi-engine ATP certification)

## What is the Restricted ATP (R-ATP)?

The R-ATP certificate provides a quicker path for aspiring pilots to enter the airline industry as First Officers, with limitations on serving as Pilot-in-Command. It is designed to allow pilots to begin their airline careers before reaching the 1,500-hour mark required for the full ATP.

### R-ATP Requirements

- **Flight Hour Reductions:** Depending on a pilot's background, the total flight hour requirements for R-ATP can be reduced:

  - 750 Hours for Military Pilots: Active or former military pilots with experience in aviation can qualify for R-ATP with just 750 flight hours.

  - 1,000 Hours for Bachelor’s Degree Graduates: Graduates from an FAA-approved aviation program can qualify for R-ATP with 1,000 flight hours.

  - 1,250 Hours for Associate Degree Graduates: Students with an associate degree from an FAA-approved aviation institution can qualify for R-ATP with 1,250 hours.

- **Age Requirement:** Pilots pursuing R-ATP can qualify at 21 years of age, allowing younger pilots to enter the airline industry sooner.
