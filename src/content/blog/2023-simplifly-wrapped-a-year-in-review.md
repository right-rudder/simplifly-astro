2023 was a big year for SimpliFly Flight School. From our operations out of **Falcon Field Airport (KFFZ) in Mesa, Arizona**, we experienced what can only be described as a record year. New students started their flight journeys. We logged countless hours in the air. We even expanded our fleet. So, before we roll into 2024, let’s take a look back at some of our best moments from 2023:

## 8,007 Total Flight Hours Logged

Our expert team of CFIs logged countless hours this year. As we grew, so did our time in the air. This is not only a testament to the durability of our fleet, but also the commitment our CFIs have to meeting the needs of each student at Simplifly Flight School.

## 87 Checkrides Passed

A leading indicator of success at Simplifly Flight School is our checkride pass rate. We historically boast a 93% pass rate on our checkrides and attribute this to the guidance we provide our students in the form of instruction, study material, and additional resources necessary for their success.

## 43 New Student Sign-Ups

2023 saw the arrival of new faces, eager to open up the skies with us. It’s been a pleasure to work with each one of these students and support their passion for flight. We hope you can be one of those fresh faces with us in 2024!

## 12 New Instructors

As much as we love welcoming new students, we’re equally proud to successfully send our graduates out of the door and on their way. In this case, we had 12 students graduate to the level of CFI, meaning they can now give back and teach the next class of pilots. Graduating from flight school is a massive accomplishment, and we want to thank everyone who has stuck with us for their whole flight journey!

## 8 Instructors Headed to New Airlines

While we have a strong student population looking for their [private pilot license](/private-pilot-training), we also prepare those who aspire to become [commercial pilots](/commercial-pilot-training). This is achievable with both our Accelerated and Flexible Flight Training Programs. In 2023, we are proud to have 8 of our instructors move on to new airlines like **Southwest**, **Allegiant**, **Frontier**, **Skywest**, and **Advanced Air**.

## 8 New Aircraft

To keep up with the demand for flight school this year, we’ve grown our fleet alongside our student body. In 2023, we acquired 8 new planes: 6 Cessna 172s, a DA40, and a Piper Seneca to support our more complex training programs. These new aircraft allow us to train more pilots overall and target specializations like an [Instrument Rating](/instrument-rating) or a [Multi-Engine Rating](/multi-engine-rating).

## Our New Simulator

Although Mesa, Arizona, lends itself to ideal weather conditions the majority of the year, there is the odd day we can’t take flight. It’s a shame when weather slows down flight training, so to remedy that, we’ve acquired a state-of-the-art, full-motion Redbird flight simulator. Continue your training no matter the conditions. Feel free to swing by and check out the simulator today!

## On to 2024…

To everyone who made this last year as exciting as it was, we thank you. Without our valued students, we would not reach the heights we continue to achieve. We look forward to welcoming more students in the coming year from across the Valley, be it Tempe, Gilbert, Mesa, or beyond!

We wish everyone a Happy New Year and cannot wait to get back up in the skies with you.
