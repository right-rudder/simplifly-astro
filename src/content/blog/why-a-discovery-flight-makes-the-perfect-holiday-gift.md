## This Year, Gift Something That Actually Takes Off

Every year, we all face the same holiday dilemma: what do you get someone?  
- A sweater? They'll forget it in a drawer
- A gadget? It'll be outdated in months
- Another gift card? They’ll lose it before January

But a **Discovery Flight**? That’s a gift they’ll remember for the rest of their life.

A Discovery Flight gives your friend, family member, or partner the chance to sit in the pilot’s seat, take the controls, and experience the thrill of flight firsthand, all alongside a certified FAA instructor. **This isn’t just a present.** It’s an adventure, a bucket-list moment, and possibly the beginning of a lifelong passion.

## What Exactly Is a Discovery Flight?

A **Discovery Flight** is a first-lesson experience designed for anyone curious about flying.  
It includes:

- A **ground briefing** with a professional flight instructor  
- An introduction to the airplane’s controls and systems  
- A real flight, where the recipient can **take the controls**  
- Photo opportunities and memories that last long beyond the holidays  

For many pilots, including airline captains, their career began with a single Discovery Flight just like this one.

At SimpliFly, we tailor each discovery lesson to the student’s comfort level, whether they want to handle the yoke or simply enjoy the ride.

## Why a Discovery Flight Is the Perfect Holiday Gift

### 1. It’s Unique, Unlike Anything Else Under the Tree  
Most gifts are things. This gift is an **experience**, and experiences are scientifically shown to create stronger emotional memories.

### 2. It’s Perfect for All Ages *(As long as they’re old enough to reach the pedals!)*  
Teens, young adults exploring career paths, aviation enthusiasts, retirees, everyone lights up when they step into the cockpit.

### 3. It Could Spark a New Career  
A Discovery Flight is more than fun; it’s a professional stepping stone. If your recipient falls in love with aviation, they can continue training toward:

- Private Pilot Certificate  
- Instrument Rating  
- Commercial Pilot Certificate  
- CFI/CFII  
- And more, all here at SimpliFly

### 4. It Beats Every “Typical Gift”  
There’s nothing ordinary about lifting off the runway with the desert landscape unfolding below. This is the kind of gift people talk about for years.

### 5. It Fits Neatly Into Anyone’s Schedule  
Flights are available year-round, and gift certificates let the recipient schedule at their convenience.

## The Holiday Atmosphere at SimpliFly

December is one of our favorite times of year. Cooler temperatures, smooth morning air, and stunning Arizona skies create ideal flying conditions, perfect for a first flight.

Our instructors love Discovery Flights during the holidays because we get to see:

- People checking a dream off their bucket list  
- Parents surprising their teens (best reaction: *“No way, is this real?!”*)  
- Couples sharing a once-in-a-lifetime adventure together  

We make the experience warm, welcoming, and unforgettable, just as a holiday gift should be.

## What Your Gift Recipient Can Expect on Flight Day

Here’s how the experience typically goes:

### Step 1 — Meet the Instructor  
Friendly handshake, quick conversation, and safety briefing.

### Step 2 — Walk Around the Aircraft  
They’ll learn about the airplane, how it works, and what they’ll be doing in the air.

### Step 3 — Take the Controls  
Once airborne, the instructor will guide them through:

- Level flight  
- Gentle turns  
- Basic maneuvering  
- A taste of what pilots experience every day  

### Step 4 — The Takeaway  
A signed logbook entry, their very first flight lesson.

It’s official: this is where their aviation journey begins.
