Here at Simplifly, we would like to take a moment to look back at how we reached modern-day flight training by rewinding the years.

The history of flight training is a captivating narrative that spans over a century, characterized by innovation, resilience, and continual adaptation. From the humble beginnings of the Wright Brothers to the sophisticated training methodologies of the present day, the evolution of aviation education mirrors the progression of human ingenuity and technological advancement.

## Flight Training: a Brief History

The inception of modern flight training can be traced back to the pioneering efforts of Orville and Wilbur Wright, whose groundbreaking achievements in aviation laid the foundation for structured pilot education. In 1910, the Wright Brothers established one of the earliest flight schools in Montgomery, Alabama, marking the birth of formalized aviation training. This institution, initially housed at Maxwell Air Force Base, served as a breeding ground for aspiring aviators, fostering a culture of innovation and exploration. Notable figures such as General Henry "Hap" Arnold and General Thomas DeWitt Milling emerged from this esteemed institution, shaping the future of military aviation.

Following the advent of World War I, the demand for skilled pilots surged, leading to the establishment of numerous flight schools across the United States. The Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP), launched in 1939, further accelerated the expansion of aviation education, aiming to train civilian pilots to meet the growing needs of wartime aviation. Post-war, the landscape of flight training underwent significant transformations, with the introduction of aeronautical engineering programs at prestigious universities like MIT and the University of Michigan. These academic initiatives not only broadened the scope of aviation education but also contributed to advancements in aircraft design and technology. Additionally, the proliferation of flight schools across the nation facilitated the democratization of aviation, making pilot training more accessible to aspiring aviators from diverse backgrounds.
