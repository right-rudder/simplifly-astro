Choosing a flight school can be a daunting task, especially for those just breaching into the wide world of aviation. With a wealth of schools to choose from and even more ways to customize your certification path, it’s no wonder the prospect of choosing once (and choosing correctly) is intimidating. SimpliFly is here to help make this choice a bit less so. Several factors should be considered when electing where to start your pilot training, and we’re going to cover many of them today.

Our goal is to ensure that every student pilot, both our own and elsewhere, is in a flight school that aligns with their values and is equipped to meet their goals in aviation, no matter how lofty they are. Simplifly would love for those dreams to be achieved with us, but it’s more important you’re where you fit best. Here are some aspects to consider when evaluating flight schools and where Simplifly fits in:

## Accreditation and Certification

Proper certification is a great place to start in your analysis of flight schools. At SimpliFly, we take pride in our Part 61 flight school status, ensuring strict adherence to the comprehensive standards set by aviation regulatory bodies. Operating under the guidelines of the FAA, our curriculum is meticulously crafted to meet and exceed the rigorous requirements, providing students with a structured and thorough training program. This accreditation reflects our commitment to maintaining the highest standards in pilot education, offering a solid foundation for aspiring aviators.

## Reputation and Reviews

A flight school is only as great as it is loved. Reputation plays a huge role in how a flight school grows in relevance. Use the feedback from former and current students to ensure they’re happy where they are. It can be key when discovering a flight school’s culture.

SimpliFly's numerous five-star reviews highlight our professionalism, affordability, and the personalized experience we provide. At SimpliFly, our commitment to fostering a positive and supportive environment ensures that our students not only succeed academically but also feel valued and supported throughout their aviation journey.

## Facilities and Aircraft Fleet

Certain aircraft are used for certain certifications. Depending on your goals, you may want to reach the levels of an Instrument Rating, requiring specific aircraft to fit that training program. Others may want to reach their [Multi Engine rating](/multi-engine-rating) and will need a plane to reach those heights. Make sure to call your potential flight schools to understand where their fleet begins and ends. Luckily, Simplifly has a fleet to fit all those above programs too.

## Curriculum and Training Program

Evaluate the training courses and programs available when choosing a flight school too. Our training programs at SimpliFly are designed to cover all essential aspects required for successful checkride prep. Combining ground school sessions, practical flight hours, and necessary materials, our structured curriculum is tailored to meet the unique needs of each pilot.

## Cost and Financial Aid

Becoming a pilot can be pricey. Making affordability a key point of consideration should help ensure you’re receiving the best value from flight schooling. Simplifly takes pride in offering pilot training at rates that make it accessible to individuals from all walks of life. We understand that the cost of training can be a significant concern, and to address this, we provide financial aid options and partnerships that help offset the financial burden associated with flight training. Our goal is to make quality pilot education achievable for everyone.

## Location

You’ll be visiting the airport frequently when approaching your aviation aspirations. To make it as accessible as possible, double-check if the location of your potential flight school fits your schedule.

SimpliFly sits at Falcon Field Airport (KFFZ) in Mesa, Arizona, and serves the greater Phoenix Valley. Our students don’t just come from Mesa, but all over like Gilbert, Chandler, Tempe, Scottsdale, and beyond. We benefit from favorable weather conditions, diverse airspace, and proximity to various airports… not to mention the stunning views of the desert as we’re in the air. Our strategic location enhances the overall training experience for our students. Weather conditions conducive to flight training, airspace complexity for a well-rounded experience, and proximity to airports for practical training all contribute to making SimpliFly an ideal location for aspiring aviators.

Our proximity to Arizona State University also provides us with unique opportunities to work with current students and graduates in constructing their pilot skills even as a university student.

We want you to graduate as quickly as we can clear you. Our extensive success stories, with over 100 graduates from SimpliFly’s pilot program, underscore the effectiveness of our training programs.
