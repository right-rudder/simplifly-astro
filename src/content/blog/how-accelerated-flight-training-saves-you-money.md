Accelerated flight training is a great option for students who want to get their pilot certificates and ratings quickly. While it is typically more expensive than traditional flight training, accelerated training can actually save students money in the long run.

Here are a few ways that accelerated flight training can save you money:

- **You get your ratings and certificates faster.** The average time to complete a traditional pilot training program is two to three years. Accelerated training programs can help you complete your training in as little as six months or less. This means you'll start earning a pilot salary sooner.

- **You avoid paying for additional flight hours.** One of the biggest costs of flight training is the cost of renting airplanes. When you train at a slower pace, you're more likely to need to spread your training out over a longer period of time. This means you'll pay more in rental fees. Accelerated training programs allow you to complete your training more quickly, which means you'll spend less on rental fees.

- **You start building seniority sooner.** Once you have your commercial pilot certificate and instrument rating, you can start building hours towards your ATP (Airline Transport Pilot) certificate. ATP pilots are in high demand by airlines, and seniority is important for determining things like scheduling and pay. By completing your training faster, you can start building seniority sooner and earn a higher salary sooner.

## How Accelerated Flight Training Can Help You Get to the Airlines Faster

One of the biggest benefits of [accelerated flight training](/accelerated-pilot-training) is that it can help you get to the airlines faster. This is because you'll start building seniority sooner. Seniority is important for pilots because it determines things like scheduling and pay. Pilots with more seniority are more likely to get their first choice of schedule and earn a higher salary.

By completing your training faster with accelerated flight training, you can start building seniority sooner and earn a higher salary sooner.

## How Accelerated Flight Training Can Help You Build the Experience You Need to Qualify for ATP

To qualify for an ATP certificate, pilots need to have a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight time. This can take several years to accumulate through traditional flight training.

Accelerated flight training programs can help you build the experience you need to qualify for ATP more quickly. This is because you'll be flying more hours per week and completing your training faster.

Once you have your ATP certificate and have built up enough experience, you can start applying for jobs with airlines. Airlines are always looking for qualified pilots, and pilots with more seniority are more likely to get hired.

Pilots with more seniority also earn a higher salary. In fact, the difference in salary between a first-year pilot and a pilot with 20 years of experience can be significant.

## How Accelerated Flight Training Can Help You Save Money in the Long Run

While accelerated flight training is typically more expensive than traditional flight training up front, it can actually save students money in the long run. This is because accelerated training can help students get to the airlines faster and start earning a pilot salary sooner.

Accelerated training can also help students avoid paying for additional flight hours and start building seniority sooner.

Let’s make a hypothetical situation. Let’s say by completing accelerated training, you’re able to make it to a regional airline in two years less than someone who was just training part time. Excluding the fact that the student who completed accelerated training most likely flew fewer hours due to retaining more knowledge and skill because of the frequency of training, let’s just look at airline pilot salaries. Please bear in mind that salaries differ with different airlines and with different experience levels, but this would be a good ballpark figure.

If the pilot sticks with the regional airline for 3 years and then moves to a major airline, they would have 4 years of total experience.

If we assume that the pilot's salary at the regional airline starts at $100k and increases by 5% each year, then their total salary over the 4 years would be:

Year 1: $100,000

Year 2: $105,000

Year 3: $110,250

Year 4: $115,763

This means that the pilot would earn a total of $431,013 over the 4 years at the regional airline.

If the pilot moves to a major airline after 4 years of experience, they would earn a salary of $100,000 to $200,000 per year, if not more.

Let's assume that the pilot earns an average salary of $150,000 per year at the major airline. This means that they would earn a total of:

Year 1: $150,000

Year 2: $150,000

Year 3: $150,000

Year 4: $150,000

This means that the pilot would earn a total of $600,000 over the 4 years at the major airline.

Therefore, by shaving off 2 years of training, the pilot would gain an additional $169,000 in salary over the 4 years.

Of course, this is just a hypothetical example. The actual salary that a pilot earns will depend on a number of factors, such as the airline they work for, their experience level, and their seniority.

However, this example shows that shaving off 2 years of training can lead to a significant financial payoff in the long run. Not only do you save time by completing accelerated training, the salary made once in the airlines pays more than what the total cost of training was. It’s a great investment to your future and your career.

## What’s next?

If you're serious about becoming a pilot, accelerated flight training is THE way to save money in the long run. By completing your training faster, you can start building seniority sooner and earn a higher salary sooner.
