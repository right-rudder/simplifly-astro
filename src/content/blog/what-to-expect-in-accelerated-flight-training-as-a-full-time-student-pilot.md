Are you thinking of becoming a pilot? If so, you may be considering accelerated flight training. This type of training can help you earn your private pilot certificate in a shorter amount of time than traditional training.

## What is Accelerated Flight Training?

Accelerated flight training is a program that allows you to earn your private pilot certificate in a shorter amount of time than traditional training. Typically, accelerated flight training programs take 3-6 months to complete, while traditional training can take 1-2 years. Continuing on to advanced rating and certifications like instrument, multi-engine, commercial, and CFII; you can go from zero to hero in potentially less than a year.

## Why Choose Accelerated Flight Training?

There are many reasons why you might choose accelerated flight training. For some people, the shorter time commitment is appealing. Others may be drawn to the more intensive training that accelerated programs offer. And still others may simply want to get their pilot's license as quickly as possible. If you're trying to make aviation a career path, then accelerated training is your best way to get the necessary certifications, start building hours, becoming a pilot and start gaining seniority in your future company.

## What to Expect in Accelerated Flight Training

As a full time student pilot, you can expect to be busy. You'll be flying multiple times a day, doing ground training, and absorbing as much aviation knowledge as you can.

### Ground Training

In ground training, you'll learn the basics of flight, including aerodynamics, navigation, and weather. You'll also learn about the different types of aircraft and how to operate them safely. You'll study the FAA's Airmen Certification Standards, which covers everything you need to know to pass the written exam. You'll also learn about the FAA's regulations and the FAR/AIM, so you can fly safely and legally.

### Flight Training

In flight training, you'll get plenty of hands on experience. You'll start with basic maneuvers like straight and level flight, climbs, decents, and turns. Then progress to stalls and more advanced maneuvers to help you gain the proper knowledge for takeoffs and landings. You'll also learn how to fly in different weather conditions, including at night and in instrument conditions. You'll complete a long cross country flight, which is a requirement for the private pilot certificate.

### Emergency Training

In emergency training, you'll learn how to handle emergencies, such as engine failure and in flight fires. This is an important part of flight training, as it can help you stay safe in the event of an emergency. You'll learn the necessary procedures to keep you alive and safe.

### Other Requirements

In addition to ground and flight training, you'll also need to meet other requirements to earn your private pilot certificate. These requirements include passing a physical exam and a background check, and passing the FAA's written and practical exams.
Tips for Success

Accelerated flight training can be challenging, but it's also very rewarding. If you're willing to put in the hard work, you'll be a private pilot in no time. Here are some tips for success:

- Be organized and efficient with your time.
- Be prepared to study and learn new information quickly.
- Be patient and don't get discouraged if you make mistakes.
- Be safety-conscious at all times.

### Additional Things to Learn

In addition to the basics, you can also expect to learn the following in accelerated flight training:

- How to communicate with air traffic control (ATC).
- How to plan and execute cross country flights.
- How to understand weather conditions.
- How to perform aeronautical decision making.
- How to maintain and understand your aircraft.
- How to navigate using charts and instruments.
- How to handle emergencies.

Accelerated flight training is a great way to earn your private pilot certificate quickly and efficiently. If you're serious about becoming a pilot, this is the way to go.
