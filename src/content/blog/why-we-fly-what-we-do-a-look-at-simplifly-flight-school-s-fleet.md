At SimpliFly Flight School in Mesa, AZ, we have carefully selected our fleet to provide the best possible training experience for our students. Our aircraft include the Cessna 172s, Diamond DA40, and Piper Seneca, each chosen for their unique strengths in training pilots. Here’s an overview of our aircraft and how they support our training programs.

## Cessna 172: The Starter

The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a cornerstone of flight training worldwide. Known for its reliability, safety, and ease of operation, the 172 is ideally suited for new students beginning their aviation journey.

The Cessna 172 is celebrated for its outstanding safety record. Its stable flight characteristics and forgiving stall behavior make it an excellent choice for initial flight training. Additionally, its tricycle landing gear provides stability and easier control during takeoff and landing, which is crucial for beginners​​.

Our Cessna 172s offer students early exposure to advanced avionics. This not only enhances safety but also prepares students for the sophisticated avionics they will encounter in more complex aircraft​​. The affordability of the 172, both in operation and maintenance, makes it a practical choice for flight schools and students alike​.

The versatility of the Cessna 172 means it can be used for a range of training activities, from private pilot lessons to advanced instrument rating courses. This flexibility allows students to build a solid foundation of skills without needing to transition to different aircraft early in their training.

## Diamond DA40: Advance Your Training

The Diamond DA40 is an excellent intermediate training aircraft, combining performance with safety. It is well-suited for both VFR (Visual Flight Rules) and IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) training.

The DA40’s composite airframe offers durability and lower maintenance costs compared to traditional aluminum airframes. This ensures the aircraft can withstand the demands of frequent training flights. The advanced avionics in the DA40 provide a smooth transition for students moving up from the Cessna 172​​.

The DA40 is also known for its fuel efficiency, reducing operational costs and minimizing environmental impact. Its efficient design makes it an ideal aircraft for cross-country navigation and night flying, providing students with a well-rounded training experience.

## Piper Seneca: The Multi-Engine Stage

For those pursuing multi-engine ratings, the Piper Seneca is our aircraft of choice. Multi-engine training is a critical step for pilots aiming to fly larger, more complex aircraft.

The Piper Seneca’s twin-engine configuration provides redundancy, an essential factor in multi-engine training. This setup helps students learn how to handle engine failures and other emergencies safely. The Seneca offers impressive performance, with the ability to operate in various weather conditions and handle longer cross-country flights​​.

Training in a multi-engine aircraft like the Seneca prepares students for the types of aircraft they will encounter in commercial aviation. The experience gained in the Seneca translates directly to real-world flying, providing a smooth transition to career flying.
